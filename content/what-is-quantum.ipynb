    "\n",
    "To cover quantum phenomena, we need to first remind ourselves of 'classical' probabilities. In this sense, 'classical' just means pre-quantum, i.e. the normal probability trees you should have seen in school. If you're already familiar with this material, you should move through it quickly. If you're not so hot on this then don't worry- we'll only cover some of the simplest probability problems possible.\n",
