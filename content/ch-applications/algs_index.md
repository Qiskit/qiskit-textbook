#About This Section

The algorithms in this section are more complicated and less general than those in chapter 3, hence their separation into a separate chapter. As we move forward into algorithms with more exciting applications, we will notice that the basic building blocks and techniques in the algorithms remain the same and the focus is shifted to adapting these to the specific problem. 


In this first section of chapter 4, we will introduce well-known quantum algorithms and the problems they solve.
