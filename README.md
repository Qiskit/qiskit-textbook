# Qiskit Textbook Source Code

This is the repository for the open-source [Learn Quantum Computation using Qiskit](http://community.qiskit.org/textbook) textbook. The textbook is intended for use as a university quantum algorithms course supplement as well as a guide for self-learners who are interested in learning quantum programming.

The Jupyter notebooks corresponding to each section of the textbook can be found in the [`content` folder](content/). The code in these notebooks will constantly be updated to the latest version of Qiskit.

The notebooks are compiled into html and exported to [the website](http://community.qiskit.org/textbook).
