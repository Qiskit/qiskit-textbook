    "### Correcting errors in phone calls\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will introduce the idea of quantum error correction. This will be done via the quantum repetition code: a simple quantum error correcting code that has all the basic features of more complex methods. Unfortunately, it is not a fully useful code in itself (which is why the more complex methods are needed). Nevertheless it is a great starting point, and a good first test of how well quantum error correction might work on a given device.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before all this, it would be helpful to first introduce the idea of error correction in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are speaking on the phone. Someone asks you a question to which the answer is 'yes' or 'no'. The way you give your response will depend on two factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How important is it that you are understood correctly?\n",
    "* How good is your connection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these can be paramaterized with probabilities. For the first, we can use $P_a$, the maximum acceptable probability of being misunderstood. If you are being asked to confirm a preference for ice cream flavours, and don't mind too much if you get vanilla rather than chocolate, $P_a$ might be quite high. If you are being asked a question on which someone's life depends, however, $P_a$ will be much lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second we can use $p$, the probability that your answer is garbled by a bad connectiom. For simplicity, let's imagine a case where a garbled 'yes' doesn't simply sound like nonsense, but sounds like a 'no'. And similarly a 'no' is transformed into 'yes'. Then $p$ is the probability that you are completely misunderstood.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your connection is very good, or the answer is not very important, we will have $p<P_a$. The probability of being misunderstood in this case is so low that you don't care. The way you answer will then be simple: you just say 'yes' or 'no'.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, however, your connection is poor and your answer is important, we will have $p>P_a$. A single 'yes' or 'no' is not enough in this case. The probability of being misunderstood would be too high.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we overcome this problem? The answer is something you would probably do without thinking: repeat yourself. Instead of 'yes', say 'yes, yes, yes'. Instead of 'no', say 'no, no no'.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the person you are talking to hears 'yes, yes, yes', they will of course conclude that you meant 'yes'. If they hear 'no, yes, yes', 'yes, no, yes' or 'yes, yes, no', they will probably conclude the same thing, since there is more positivity than negativity in the answer. To be misunderstood in this case, at least two of your replies need to be garbled. The probability for this, $P$, will be less than $p$. So your message will be more likely to be understood."

The fact that $P<p$ above comes from the fact that we need at least two replies to be garbled to flip the majority, and so even the most likely possibilities have a probability of $\\sim p^2$. For five repetitions we'd need at least three replies to be garbled to flip the majority, which happens with probability $\\sim p^3$. The value for $P$ in this case would then be even lower. Indeed, as we increase the number of repetitions, $P$ will decrease exponentially. No matter how bad the connection, or how certain we need to be of our message getting through correctly, we can acheive it by just repeating our answer enough times.\n",

Instead we consider two forms of error that can occur. One is a gate error: an imperfection in any operation we perform. We model this here in a simple way, using so-called depolarizing noise. The effect of this will be, with probabilty $p_{gate}$ ,to replace the state of any qubit with a completely random state. For two qubit gates, it is applied independently to each qubit.\n",

    "### Storing qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have considered cases where there is no delay between encoding and decoding. For qubits, this means that there is no significant amount of time that passes between initializing the circuit, and making the final measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are many cases for which there will be a significant delay. As an obvious example, one may wish to encode a quantum state and store it for a long time, like a quantum hard drive. A less obvious but much more important example is performing fault-tolerant quantum computation itself. For this, we need to store quantum states and preserve their integrity during the computation. This must also be done in a way that allows us to manipulate the stored information in any way we need, and which corrects any errors we may introduce when performing the manipulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all cases, we need account for the fact that errors do not only occur when something happens (like a gate or measurement), they also occur when the qubits are idle. Such noise is due to the fact that the qubits interact with each other and their environment. The longer we leave our qubits idle for, the greater the effects of this noise becomes. If we leave them for long enough, we'll encounter a situation like the $p_{meas}=0.5$ case above, where the noise is too strong for errors to be reliably corrected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to keep measuring throughout. Don't leave your qubit idle for too long, but keep extracting information to keep track of the errors that have occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the case of classical information, where we simply wish to store a `0` or `1`, this can be done by just constantly measuring the value of each qubit. Then we will keep track of when the values change due to noise, and can easily deduce a history of when errors occurred. \n",
    "\n",
    "For quantum information, however, it is not so easy. For example, consider the case that we wish to encode the state $\\left|+\\right\\rangle$. Our encoding is such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\rightarrow \\left|000\\right\\rangle,~~~ \\left|1\\right\\rangle \\rightarrow \\left|111\\right\\rangle.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To encode the $\\left|+\\right\\rangle$ state we therefore need\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left|+\\right\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle+\\left|1\\right\\rangle\\right)\\rightarrow \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\left|000\\right\\rangle+\\left|111\\right\\rangle\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It will be convenient to now introduce some terminology. In the expression above, there are two different concepts that we can refer to as a 'qubit'. One is that of the 'physical qubit'. These are the actual physical qubits that exist on a chip. There are three physical qubits in the above expression. The other type of qubit is the 'logical' qubit. This is a qubit state, encoded across multiple physical qubits, with the hope that our physical qubit will experience less noise than the physical qubits they are made up of. In the above expression there is a single logical qubit, which is in the state $\\left|+\\right\\rangle$ and encoded across three physical qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the repetition encoding that we are using, a z measurement of the logical qubit is done using a z measurement of each physical qubit. The final result for the logical measurement is decoded from the physical qubit measurement results by simply looking which output is in the majority.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, we can keep track of errors on logical qubits that are stored for a long time by constantly performing z measurements of the physical qubits. However, note that this effectively corresponds to constantly peforming z measurements of the physical qubits. This is fine if we are simply storing a `0` or `1`, but it has undesired effects if we are storing a superposition. Specifically: the first time we do such a check for errors, we will collapse the superposition!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not ideal. If we wanted to do some computation on our logical qubit, or is we wish to peform a basis change before final measurement, we need to preserve the superposition. Destroying it is an error. But this is not an error caused by imperfections in our devices. It is an error that we have introduced as part of our attempts to correct errors. And since we cannot hope to recreate any arbitrary superposition stored in our quantum computer, it is an error than cannot be corrected.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, we must find another way of keeping track of the errors that occur when our logical qubit is stored for long times. This should give us the information we need to detect and correct errors, and to decode the final measurment result with high probability. However, it should not cause uncorrectable errors to occur during the process by collapsing superpositions that we need to preserve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to do this is with the following circuit element."

    "Our task when confronted with any of the possible outcomes we see here is to determine what the outcome should have been, if there was no noise. For an outcome of `'000 00'` or `'111 00'`, the answer is obvious. These are the results we just saw for a logical `0` and logical `1`, respectively, when no errors occur. The former is the most common outcome for the logical `0` even with noise, and the latter is the most common for the logical `1`. We will therefore conclude that the outcome was indeed that for logical `0` whenever we encounter `'000 00'`, and the same for logical `1` when we encounter `'111 00'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though this tactic is optimal, it can nevertheless fail. Note that `'111 00'` typically occurs in a handful of cases for an encoded `0`, and `'00 00'` similarly occurs for an encoded `1`. In this case, through no fault of our own, we will incorrectly decode the output. In these cases, a large number of errors conspired to make it look like we had a noiseless case of the opposite logical value, and so correction becomes impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can employ a similar tactic to decode all other outcomes. The outcome `'001 00'`, for example, occurs far more for a logical `0` than a logical `1`. This is because it could be caused by just a single measurement error in the former case (which incorrectly reports a single `0` to be `1`), but would require at least two errors in the latter. So whenever we see `'001 00'`, we can decode it as a logical `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying this tactic over all the strings is a form of so-called 'lookup table decoding'. This is where every possible outcome is analyzed, and the most likely value to decode it as is determined. For many qubits, this quickly becomes intractable, as the number of possible outcomes becomes so large. In these cases, more algorithmic decoders are needed. However, lookup table decoding works well for testing out small codes.\n",

    "### Basic principles of quantum error correction\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned that the start of this section, the repetition code is a simple example of the basic principles of quantum error correction. These are as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The information we wish to store and process takes the form of 'logical qubits'. The states of these are encoded across many of the actual 'physical qubits' of a device.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Information about errors is extracted constantly through a process of 'syndrome' measurement. These consist of measurements that extract no information about the logical stored information. Instead they assess collective properties of groups of physical qubits, in order to determine when faults arise in the encoding of the logical qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The information from syndrome measurements allows the effects of errors to be identified and mitigated for with high probability. This requires a decoding method.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another basic principle for which the repetition code is not such a good example.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Manipulating stored information must require action on multiple physical qubits. The minimum number required for any code is is known as the distance of the code, $d$. Possible manipulations include performing an `x` operation on the logical qubit (flipping an encoded $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ to an encoded $\\left|1\\right\\rangle$, and vice-versa), or performing a logical z measurement (distinguishing an encoded $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ from an encoded $\\left|1\\right\\rangle$).\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it harder to perform operations on logical qubits when required: both for us, and for errors. The latter is, of course, the reason why this behaviour is required. If logical information could be acessed using only a single physical qubit, it would always be possible for single stray errors to disturb the logical qubit. The aim is usually to make it relatively straightforward for us to perform logical operations, given that we know how to do it, but hard for noise to achieve it by random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of making it hard for noise to peform a logical `x`, the repetition code cannot be beaten: All code qubits must be flipped to flip the logical value. From this perspective, $d=n$. For a z measurement, however, the repetition code is very poor. In the ideal case of no errors, the logical z basis information is repeated across every code qubit. Measuring any single code qubit is therefore sufficient to deduce the logical value. For this logical operation, and the overal distance, is therefore $d=1$ for the repetition code. This is also reflected by the fact that the code is unable to detect and correct logical `z` errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a better example of quantum error correction, we therefore need to find alternatives to the repetition approach. One of the foremost examples is the surface code, which will be added to this textbook as soon as it is implemented in Ignis."
